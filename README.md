This project was made for the MSB1014 - Network Biology course at Maastricht University.

The main workflow is provided in the Project.ipynb Jupyter notebook file. You many need to install certain python packages such as 'bctpy' and 'nilearn'.

The data used in the project is contained in the github repository and once the appropriate packages are installed, the script should run smoothly.

The clustering of the NBS result is done in R and Cytoscape. You must first import the diff_component.adj file into Cytoscape then you can run the .Rmd script to perform the network clustering.
